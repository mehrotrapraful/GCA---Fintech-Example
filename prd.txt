Product Requirements Document: Fintech Payment Aggregator
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a Fintech Payment Aggregator application. The goal is to create a robust, secure, and user-friendly platform that enables businesses to seamlessly accept and manage online payments from various sources through a single integration. This platform will abstract the complexity of integrating with multiple payment gateways, providing a unified interface for transaction processing, monitoring, and reporting.
1.1. Purpose
The purpose of this payment aggregator is to simplify the online payment acceptance process for merchants of all sizes. By providing a single API and dashboard, we aim to reduce the technical burden and operational overhead associated with managing multiple payment gateway integrations. This will allow businesses to focus on their core operations while offering their customers a wide range of payment options.
1.2. Goals
Become the preferred payment processing solution for Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) and enterprises.
Increase successful transaction rates for merchants by offering diverse payment methods and intelligent routing (future enhancement).
Provide merchants with comprehensive tools for transaction monitoring, reconciliation, and reporting.
Ensure the highest level of security and compliance with relevant financial regulations.
Offer a developer-friendly API for easy integration.
Provide excellent customer support for merchants.
1.3. Scope
This PRD covers the core features required for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the payment aggregator, including:
Merchant Onboarding and Account Management
Payment Processing (covering major payment methods)
Transaction Management and Monitoring
Reporting and Analytics
Security and Compliance
API for Merchant Integration
1.4. Out of Scope (for MVP)
The following features are considered out of scope for the MVP:
Advanced fraud detection beyond basic checks provided by integrated gateways.
Customer-facing hosted payment pages (merchants will typically use their own integration).
Integration with physical Point of Sale (POS) systems.
Lending or credit facilities for merchants.
Direct wallet top-up services.
Multi-currency settlement (initially focus on one primary currency).
Dynamic currency conversion.
2. Target Audience
The primary target audience for this application is businesses (merchants) who need to accept online payments. This includes:
E-commerce stores
Online service providers
Subscription-based businesses
Marketplaces (as the underlying payment infrastructure for sub-merchants - future enhancement)
The secondary audience includes developers who will integrate their platforms with our API.
3. Features
